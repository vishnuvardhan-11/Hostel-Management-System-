## Overview
The **Hostel Management System** is a Python-based application designed to streamline and automate hostel management operations. It allows administrators to manage student records, assign rooms, update fees, and save or retrieve data seamlessly. This project simplifies hostel operations by eliminating manual record-keeping and improving data accessibility.

---

## Features
- **Add Student**: Register a new student with details like ID, name, age, and gender.
- **Assign Room**: Assign a room number to a specific student.
- **Update Fees**: Mark a student's fees as paid.
- **View Student**: Display detailed information about a specific student.
- **Delete Student**: Remove a student's record from the system.
- **Save and Load Data**: Persist data across sessions using a file (`students.txt`).

---

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Concepts**:
  - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
  - File Handling
